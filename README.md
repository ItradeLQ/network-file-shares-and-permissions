<h1>Network File Shares and Permissions</h1>
In this tutorial we will create file shares with different permissions and attempt to access them.<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machine, Domain Controller, Client-1 machine)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- Shared Network Files

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Windows Server 2022


<h2>File Shares and Observation</h2>

Login to DC-1 as your Domain Admin account. My case it's (mydomain.com\jane_admin) and create folders with varying sharing permissions.
  
Login to Client-1 as a normal user (mydomain\<normaluser>)
  
  
On DC-1, go to the c:\ drive and create four folders “read-access”, “write-access”, “no-access”, “accounting”

Set the following permissions, and share the folder for the “Domain Users” group.
  
  
Folder: “read-access”, Group: “Domain Users”, Permission: “Read” and to do that right click -> properties -> sharing>share -> type domain users and share.
  
  
Folder: “write-access”,  Group: “Domain Users”, Permissions: “Read/Write”

  
Folder: “no-access”, Group: “Domain Admins”, “Permissions: “Read/Write”

Skip the accounting folder for now.

Choose a normal user from the list of names created, from the script in Configure Active Directory tutorial. 
Login to Client-1. Once logged in, open file explorer and type (\\dc-1), to view the shared folders in the network.<p/>

Try to access the folder that you created. Which folders you can access? Which folders can you create files in? 
In the write-access folder, you can create a file.

Open up DC-1, navigate to the network path with the folders, and create a text file, you can only read me.
Now return to Client-1 as the normal user, go to the file explorer path: (\\dc:), and interact with the file. 
Try deleting the file and what happens? </p>

Go to the DC-1, in Active Directory Users and Groups -> right click mydomain.com -> new -> Organisational Unit -> _SECURITY_GROUPS. Then refresh mydomian.com.</p>

Within the  "_Security_Groups", add a new group name "ACCOUNTANTS". </p>

Return to DC-1 to update the sharing permissions to the accounting folder.

Go to file explorer and navigate to where you created the “accounting” folder (path:\\dc-1) you created earlier, set the following permissions: “Read/Write”
  
On the “accounting” folder: Right click -> properties -> sharing -> share -> ACCOUNTANTS -> CLICK add -> read and write -> share -> done -> close.

On Client-1, try to access the Accounting folder. It will fail because the normal user doesn't have permission to access the folder.</p>

On DC-1 add the normal user as a member of the "ACCOUNTANTS" Security group.

When you try to access the accounting folder  as the normal user in Client-1, it will say Windows cannot access it. 
This is because the permissions haven't been fully updated.
To gain access logoff from Client-1 and log back in as the normal user to access the Accounting shared file in \DC-1. 
Permission will now be granted to gain access to the "Accounting" folder.</p>
